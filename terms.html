We may add, remove, or change features at any time.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="acceptance">
          <h3>Acceptance of Terms and Changes</h3>
          <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated through in-App notices or other reasonable means. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. It is your responsibility to check these Terms periodically.</p>

By creating an account you represent and warrant that you have legal capacity to enter into contracts. Accounts are created by providing a phone number you control, and completing the verification process we require.
